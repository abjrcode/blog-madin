# Welcome

This is _the_ first post on this blog and hopefully the beginning of many more to come.

\
**Madin** _(pronounced as one would say "Made In" but as a single word)_ is intended to be a place for me to share my thoughts and ideas, as well as a place to learn from others.

\
I have been writing software for well over a decade now. Specifically, I have worked on [Enterprise applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software), or what is sometimes known in the industry as [Line of Business (LOB)](https://www.irisclasson.com/2012/07/19/stupid-question-2-what-do-you-mean-by-lob-line-of-business-application/) application. The boring kind you know: a database, some business rules, a user interface and reporting _(wait, that actually might be most of software)_

\
I have used many languages and frameworks over the years. Started with Pascal back during school days and then on to Java and Python, then C# with .NET and lately I have been doing quite some TypeScript. I've also experimented with Go and Rust. Hell, I even learned CSS then built this very website with it.

\
I've always been more focused on the "backend" _(database, business logic)_ side of things, and, have gained quite some experience along the way with things like [Domain Driven Design (DDD)](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html) and [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html).

\
But, guess what, this blog is not about any of those things -- at least not for now. It is more about exploring everything else outside those realms. Think compilers, games, algorithms, AI , and, perhaps even some Math and Physics.

\
Next up we will build a very small, actually super small, compiler for a super tiny language. But, we will do it end to end; We will have a type checker, basic integration with Visual Studio Code through a [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and native code generation using [LLVM](https://llvm.org/).

\
So, stay tuned!
