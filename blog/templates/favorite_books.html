    You will find below a list of some of my all time favorite books. I used two
    criterion for including a book in this list:
  </p>
  <ul class="pl-4 list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
    <li>I have read the entire book, cover to cover</li>
    <li>I enjoyed reading the book, learned a lot from it or both</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Computer Science</h1>

  <h2>Databases & Distributed Systems</h2>
  <ul class="list-inside">
    <li>
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321"
        >Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a
      >
      <span class="italic"> - Martin Kleppmann</span>

      <p class="pl-4 text-base">
        While the title suggests that you might be reading about large scale
        data intensive systems, this is not really the case. It is more about
        how databases and distributed systems work and it serves both as an
        excellent explanation as well as a reference. I recommend this if you
        have been building enterprise applications and have a few years of
        experience under your belt. Excellent book.

  <h1>Mathematics</h1>

  <div>
    <a
      target="_blank"
      href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Math-Heart-Hidden-Reality/dp/0465050743"
      >Love and Math</a
    >

    <span class="italic"> - Edward Frenkel </span>

    <p class="pl-4 text-base">
      Don't let the title fool you. This is not apoetic book. It is one that
      tries to show you the beautiful side of Mathematics. Ones you probably
      weren't exposed to in school. It is not meant to teach you mathematics but
      to show you what it is like to be a mathematician. The reason I loved this
      book is that it takes you on a whirlwind tour in the different landscapes
      of mathematics. It shows how the different pieces of the puzzle fit
      together, and the author has an amazing talent in explaining very complex
      and esoteric concepts very intuitively. I wish "actual" math books were so
      approachable and intuitive.

  <h2>Pure Math</h2>
  <ul class="list-inside">
    <li>
      <a
        target="_blank"
        href="https://www.people.vcu.edu/~rhammack/BookOfProof/"
        >Book of Proof 3rd Edition</a
      >

      <span class="italic"> - Richard Hammack </span>

      <p class="pl-4 text-base">
        First of all, this book is free. Second, it is an excellent introduction
        to set theory, logic and proof writing. It has a ton of examples and the
        author explains everything intuitively.
